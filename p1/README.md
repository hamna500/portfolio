# E-commerce Dataset Analysis

This project entails an in-depth analysis of a combined e-commerce dataset, aimed at extracting valuable insights regarding user behavior, product ratings, and review trends. The dataset encompasses a wide array of information, including user profiles, product details, ratings, reviews, and more. Through meticulous data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, and visualization techniques, this analysis endeavors to unravel patterns, trends, and correlations inherent in the dataset.

## Dataset Overview

The provided dataset, named 'A Combined E-commerce Dataset.csv', merges information from various sources, offering a comprehensive view of the e-commerce landscape. Each entry in the dataset represents a user's interaction with a product, encompassing details such as:

- **User Information**: User ID, gender, city of birth.
- **Product Details**: Item ID, name, category, price.
- **Rating and Review**: User ratings, reviews, timestamp of the rating, average helpfulness.
- **Data Completeness**: Removal of missing data, ensuring data integrity and accuracy.

## Analysis Objectives

1. **Data Cleaning**: 
   - Eliminate records with missing gender, rating, or helpfulness.
   - Remove reviews labeled as 'none' for improved data quality.
   
2. **Descriptive Statistics**:
   - Identify unique users, reviews, items, and categories.
   - Analyze rating distribution, mean, standard deviation, min, and max.
   - Explore gender-based rating patterns and item-rating distributions.
   
3. **Correlation Exploration**:
   - Investigate correlations between gender/helpfulness/category and ratings.
   - Assess whether gender influences rating tendencies.
   - Examine how helpfulness and category impact user ratings.

4. **Outlier Detection and Removal**:
   - Define outlier users, reviews, and items based on predefined rules.
   - Remove outlier records to enhance the robustness of the analysis.
